**REFUTING THE FALSE PRINCIPLE: "IT IS NOT BINDING UPON ME**

_Al-Allãmah Al-Imãm Rabī'Bn Hãdī Al-Madkhalī (may Allãh preserve him) said:_

If two scholars from the scholars of Al-jarh wat-Ta'dīl (criticsm and praise) or other than them differ in a religious affair, then the ruling regarding the affair is for Allãh, not desire and its people who do take the word of the mistaken one and reject the word of the correct one; that which is obligatory in that which the scholars differ over in the affair of the religion is returning it to Allāh and The Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Allãh The Exalted said:

O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.
\[Sūratun-Nisã, verse: 59]

So the word of the two differing (scholars) will be looked into in light of the Sharī'ah and its principles that were derived from it, not fabricated ones, so whoever's speech agrees with the Sharī'ah, it is obligatory to take his speech and whoever opposes it, his word will be rejected while respecting him and believing that he is a mujtahid \[²] and he has has the reward of an erroneous mujtahid \[³] and a Muslim who is following (The Book and Sunnah) shouldn't take the position of the people of desires by saying: the scholars have differed, so the word of so and so is not binding upon me, then he start playing with the intellect of the people.

Verily the likes of this statement do give people the courage to reject the truth and drop its people \[⁴], the one who possesses evidence, it is obligatory to take his statement following in that the Sharī'ah and evidence of Allãh, not the personality of that man and the blackness of his eyes.
