Allãh The Exalted said:\r\n\r\nO you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.\r\n\\[Sūratun-Nisã, verse: 59]\r\n\r\nSo the word of the two differing (scholars) will be looked into in light of the Sharī'ah and its principles that were derived from it, not fabricated ones, so whoever's speech agrees with the Sharī'ah, it is obligatory to take his speech and whoever opposes it, his word will be rejected while respecting him and believing that he is a mujtahid \\[²] and he has has the reward of an erroneous mujtahid \\[³] and a Muslim who is following (The Book and Sunnah) shouldn't take the position of the people of desires by saying: the scholars have differed, so the word of so and so is not binding upon me, then he start playing with the intellect of the people.\r\n\r\nVerily the likes of this statement do give people the courage to reject the truth and drop its people \\[⁴], the one who possesses evidence, it is obligatory to take his statement following in that the Sharī'ah and evidence of Allãh, not the personality of that man and the blackness of his eyes.\r\n\r\nSource: \\[The scholars of Al-jarh wat-Ta'dīl are the protectors of the religion, page 29–30]\r\n\r\n`Notes and translation by:`\r\nLukmãn Bn Abdir-Rauf As-Sãlafī\r\n\r\n29th of Dhul-Qa'dah 1443AH\r\nCorresponding to 28th of June, 2022CE\r\n"

    "content": "\r\n_In the name of Allāh, The Most Beneficent The Most Merciful._\r\n\r\nAll praise is due to Allāh, The Lord of The world and may Allāh praise and send peace and blessing upon His Slave and messenger and the best of his creation, Our Prophet and Leader, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) the son of Abdillãh and upon his relatives and companions and whoever thread his path and follow his guidance till the day of judgement.\r\n\r\n> To proceed:\r\n\r\nO noble listeners, my speech with you today is about the obligation of Islãmic cultivation. The Islãmic cultivation is from the most important of affairs and the most obligatory of obligations. (It is obligatory) upon every Muslims to cultivate himself with the Islãmic cultivation and to strive in cultivating his household like children, brothers and others because that is the way and path to everyone's safety from the fire and to the rectification of the society in this world.\r\n\r\nSo it is obligatory upon everyone to cooperate on this affair and advice one another with it so that everyone will be upright upon noble ethics and praiseworthy characters and noble actions and so that they will be deserving with that the virtue of The Lord –The Mighty and Exalted– and His dignity in this world and success with Jannah and happiness in the hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt has come in the Noble Qur'ãn and the pure Sunnah that which is pointing to the obligatory of this affair, Allāh said in His noble book:\r\n\r\n**یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قُوۤا۟ أَنفُسَكُمۡ وَأَهۡلِیكُمۡ نَارࣰا وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلۡحِجَارَةُ عَلَیۡهَا مَلَـٰۤىِٕكَةٌ غِلَاظࣱ شِدَادࣱ لَّا یَعۡصُونَ ٱللَّهَ مَاۤ أَمَرَهُمۡ وَیَفۡعَلُونَ مَا یُؤۡمَرُونَ﴾ [التحريم ٦]**\r\n\r\n_O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded._\r\n\r\n**[Sūratu-Tahrīm, verse: 6]**\r\n\r\nIn this great great verse, He (Allāh) commanded everyone, He commanded all the believers to save themselves and their households from the punishment of Allāh and that can't be except by staying upright upon the commandments of Allāh and advising one another with the right of Allāh and abstaining from the prohibitions of Allāh.\r\n\r\nThis is the pure Islãmic cultivation through which happiness and safety (can be attained) in the world and the hereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd due to this, Allāh The Blessed said:\r\n\r\n_O you who believe_\r\n\r\nHe called the people of faith because they are the people of compliance (to the commandments of Allāh) in the complete manner in opposition to other than them, because their compliance might occur and it might not occur and it might be weak. As for the people of faith, the people of attestation (to the truth), the people of insight, their compliance to the commandment of Allāh is the most complete and their obedience to Him is the most perfect, He –the Mighty and Majestic– said:\r\n\r\n**یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قُوۤا۟ أَنفُسَكُمۡ وَأَهۡلِیكُمۡ نَارࣰا**\r\n\r\n_O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)_\r\n\r\nIf that is not the case, then that which is well known is that Allāh created everyone for His worship and He commanded them to follow His Messengers\r\n\r\nSo that which is obligatory upon everyone from the Arab and the non-Arab and from the Jinn and mankind, that which is obligatory upon everyone is to fear Allãh and to save themselves and their families from the punishment of Allāh, this is obligatory upon everyone as Allāh said:\r\n\r\n**یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ**\r\n\r\n_O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord_\r\n\r\n**[Sūratun-Nisā, verse 1]**\r\n\r\n**یَـٰۤأَیُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعۡبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ**\r\n\r\n_O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah)_\r\n\r\n**[Sūratul-Baqarah, verse 21]**\r\n\r\nSo it is obligatory upon everyone to worship Allāh and fear Him –The Blessed– and that is by singling him out in His rights and being sincere to Him in worship and following The Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) after Allāh has sent him as it is obligatory upon every nation of the Prophets before Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to obey the Messengers and follow them in what they have brought.\r\n\r\nIt is obligatory upon the nation of every Prophet to follow its Prophet and to be upright upon what he came with of legislation, with this, happiness and success will be theirs.\r\n\r\nLink to the original Arabic from the Shaikh's website\r\n\r\n[binbaz](https://binbaz.org.sa/audios/182/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9)\r\n"
